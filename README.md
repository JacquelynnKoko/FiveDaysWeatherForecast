A simple program that forecast the 5 days weather using MVVM architech. and show live weather data after being fetch from the API.

Tested on the both mobile and tablet version. Autocomplete Textview/Dropdownlist is populated with JSON file downloaded from openweathermap. Search the city or selecting the city triggers the fetching of the forecast Once being fetched, it will update in the viewmodel Repo then save the updated data to Database(ROOM)

Done this in the short period of time so there might have bugs. Some of the exceptions might not being handled properly. Did not get the certificate from the API and SSL pinning. UI is very simple with not much of coloring.

If i have more time , I would like to show more weather infomations in the viewpager
